Looi-Java-Supplement

This project is called Looi-Java-Supplement, formerly called the Looi-Engine. 

The main goal of Looi-Java-Supplement is to make it easy for Java programmers to add a GUI interface to their program. With just one line of code, which is Window w = new Window(), one can create a functioning window that appears on the screen. With this window, one can choose to create either a standard GUI interface, using classes from the package ljs.gui, or one can create a full fledged video-game using classes from ljs.gui.looicanvas. A smaller goal of Looi-Java-Supplement is to improve productivity by providing useful utility methods such as the "range" method, the "opt" method, and the "arrayList" method, which will help programmers save time because they provide instant solutions to common problems.

To use Looi-Java-Supplement effectively, for each file one must import static ljs.Obj.* if they want to access the utility methods, and they must import ljs.gui.* if they want to access
